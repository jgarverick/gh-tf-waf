# GitHub Well-Architected Framework Implementation

This repository provides a Terraform-based implementation of the [GitHub Well-Architected Framework](https://wellarchitected.github.com/). It helps you establish and maintain a secure, reliable, and efficient GitHub environment by codifying best practices across key pillars.

## Pillars

This implementation covers the following pillars:

- **[Architecture](pillars/architecture.tf)**: Defines the structure and components of your GitHub environment, promoting modularity and scalability.
- **[Application Security](pillars/appsec.tf)**: Implements security best practices to protect your code and data.
- **[Collaboration](pillars/collaboration.tf)**: Enhances team collaboration through standardized templates, labels, and workflows.
- **[Governance](pillars/governance.tf)**: Establishes policies and controls to manage your GitHub organization effectively.
- **[Productivity](pillars/productivity.tf)**: Automates tasks and streamlines workflows to improve team productivity.

## Modules

The repository is organized into reusable Terraform modules:

- **[action/](modules/action/)**: For creating and managing GitHub Actions.
- **[auth/](modules/auth/)**: For authentication-related resources.
- **[enterprise/](modules/enterprise/)**: For enterprise-level settings.
- **[org/](modules/org/)**: For organization-level settings.
- **[project/](modules/project/)**: For managing GitHub Projects.
- **[project_boards/](modules/project_boards/)**: For creating and configuring project boards.
- **[project_view/](modules/project_view/)**: For customizing project views.
- **[repo/](modules/repo/)**: For managing GitHub repositories.
- **[ruleset/](modules/ruleset/)**: For defining and enforcing rulesets.
- **[team/](modules/team/)**: For managing teams and permissions.

## Templates

The `templates/` directory contains templates for issues, pull requests, and other collaborative elements:

- **[bug_report.md](templates/bug_report.md)**: Template for bug reports.
- **[feature_request.md](templates/feature_request.md)**: Template for feature requests.
- **[meeting_template.md](templates/meeting_template.md)**: Template for team meeting notes.
- **[pull_request_template.md](templates/pull_request_template.md)**: Template for pull requests.
- **[release_template.md](templates/release_template.md)**: Template for release notes.
- **[workflows/](templates/workflows/)**: GitHub Actions workflows for automation.
